# Kulan

A 2015 study found the median net worth for white households in Greater Boston was a quarter million dollars. For Black families, it was just $8.

This reality led to the inspiration for Kulan. A full stack application that makes it easier to find and invest in black owned businesses, by quickly finding the nearest black owned business selling the goods or providing the services that the client is in need of. 

Kulan is a Somali word that means “To Gather” or “ To Meet” and that is the core principle of the application. To help make it easier for the community to meet up and to gather around our business and to invest into our community.
